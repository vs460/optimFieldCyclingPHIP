A projection algorithm for gradient waveforms design in Magnetic Resonance Imaging. N. Chauffert, P. Weiss, J. Kahn and P. Ciuciu, submitted (2014).

First examples : - 'script_example_gradient_waveform.m' shows the behaviour of the
algorithm. 	 - 'script_example_affine_constraints.m' shows how to add affine constraints
such as starting and end points, gradient moment nulling ...

Comparison to optimal reparameterization (script_illustration_*.m). The 
'Time Optimal Gradient Design' is required (see
 http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/Software.html). 
These codes reproduce experiments depicted in Fig. 5 and 6 in the paper.
